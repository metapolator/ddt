title: Rigorous Font Quality Testing
---

This project is developing a small web application for measuring the quality of type designs.

**[Demo at testmyfont.com/demo](http://testmyfont.com/demo)** ([source](https://github.com/typefacedesign/document-driven-typedesign/tree/master))

A web application to compare typefaces and review them in a systematic way is under development. 
The initial prototype was developed in 2014, with UX Design by [Dave Crossland](https://github.com/davelab6) and [Chris Mahon](https://github.com/chrismahon), and Web Development by [Ankur Sethi](https://github.com/s3thi).
